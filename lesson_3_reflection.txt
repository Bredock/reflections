When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you work from different places or with different people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because an important change may have different commits, and you don't need 
    to upload everytime you make a commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches happen on a single repository, it's differents versions of the file. 
    Cloning is taking an entire repository and make a copy, either local or from 
    remote to local (or viceversa). Fork is cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub.
    The fork links back to the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In the last state you have a history of all the previos states.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Sending a copy of the file to the colaborators each time you make a change and changing
    all the files manually.
    It's a lot easier with GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
